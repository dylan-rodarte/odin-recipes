        <p>Nobody loves food spoilage. It's bad for the planet, bad for our wallets, and bad 
            for our tastebuds. But, with some simple techniques and common household 
            ingredients, you can preserve (and even upgrade!) the flavor of fruits, veggies,
            and other staples. Whether you had a bumper crop in your garden, went a little
            too wild in the produce section at the store, or simply want to capture the flavor
            of your favorite seasonal ingredient, there are a variety of techniques even an 
            inexperienced home chef can harness! </p>
