        <p>Note: given the nature of fermentation, it is important to understand the mechanisms behind what is happening, 
            and ensure you are taking all the necessary precautions to make your process as safe as possible. 
            While these steps I have laid out are simple, an absolute beginner should always cross-check what I have 
            said here against other, more reputable sources available. Never take a single source as gospel, 
            especially not when your health is on the line!</p>
